## Overview
**UMIS (Upemba Medical Information System)** is a comprehensive medical management platform originally tailored for the Upemba National Park Medical Department. Built with a modern stack (Django & Next.js), its modular architecture makes it highly adaptable and ready to be customized by other clinics, hospitals, and medical establishments.

## Features
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Designed to function fully without an internet connection using local SQLite and standalone deployments.
- **Beneficiaries Management**: Secure, comprehensive management of employees and their dependents.
- **Pharmacy & Inventory**: Track stock movements, consumption, historical requisitions, and low-stock alerts.
- **Secure Access**: JWT-based authentication with strict domain validations (`@forgottenparks.org`).
- **Bilingual Interface**: Fully translated and localized in English and French.
- **1-Click Installation**: Frictionless USB or Internet-based Windows installer for zero-touch deployments.

## Quickstart Installation

We offer a 1-click installer for Windows users (via PowerShell).

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bonheurNE07/upemba-medical/main/scripts/install-umis.ps1 | iex"
```
*For offline installation via USB, please refer to our [Distribution Guide](/docs/DISTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md).*

## Architecture

UMIS utilizes a modern monolithic-but-decoupled architecture packaged together for offline distribution:
- **Backend**: Django & Django REST Framework
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), TailwindCSS, built as static files and served natively by Django.
- **Database**: SQLite (Zero configuration needed).
