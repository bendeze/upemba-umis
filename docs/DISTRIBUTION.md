# UMIS Distribution Guide: Python Wheels & Standalone Executables

Welcome to the **Upemba Medical Information System (UMIS)** deployment reference sheet. This document details how to package, distribute, and run your software offline on employee computers. It explains the mechanics behind **Universal Wheels** and **Standalone Executables (`.exe`)**, how they work conceptually, and how to rebuild them.

---

## 1. Core Concepts: What are Wheels and Executables?

| Concept | Python Wheel (`.whl`) | Standalone Executable (`.exe`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **What it is** | A standard Python package archive (a zip file with metadata) that installs directly into an existing Python environment. | A single, compiled Windows binary containing the app, resources, and the Python interpreter itself. |
| **Prerequisites** | The target computer **must** have Python installed (any version like 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 if universal). | **Zero prerequisites.** Works on any Windows 10/11 computer out-of-the-box. |
| **How it runs** | Executed in a terminal via a launcher command (e.g. `py -m cli` or `umis-start`). | Executed like a normal Windows program by double-clicking the `UMIS.exe` icon. |
| **IP Protection** | Code can be obfuscated into bytecode (`.pyc`), but bytecode is version-locked to a specific Python release. | High security; code and interpreter are bundled together in a single binary. |

## 2. Behind the Scenes: How the Packaging Pipeline Works

The UMIS build system utilizes a **Next.js static-export pipeline** combined with **Django asset staging** to deliver a single, offline-first application:

```
[Next.js Frontend] ──(npm run build)──> [Static Export: HTML/CSS/JS]
                                                  │
                                          (Staged Into)
                                                  ▼
                                       [Django App: core/static]
                                                  │
                      ┌───────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┐
                      ▼                                                      ▼
           [Python Wheel Pipeline]                               [PyInstaller Compiler]
         (python setup.py bdist_wheel)                             (pyinstaller umis.spec)
                      │                                                      │
                      ▼                                                      ▼
         umis-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl                                      UMIS.exe
        (Runs on any Python system)                            (Runs on any Windows PC)
```

1. **Frontend Export:** The Next.js frontend compiles all React pages into static HTML exports (`output: 'export'` in `next.config.ts`).
2. **Asset Staging:** These static files are copied directly into the Django **`core/static/`** folder, and the base `index.html` is placed in **`core/templates/`**. This ensures the frontend is physically packaged inside the Django app.
3. **Django URL Routing:** When the browser calls a file (like `/_next/static/chunks/...`), Django catches the route and serves the embedded Next.js static asset instantly from the `core/static` package directory.
4. **Binary Compilation:**
   * **For Wheels:** Setuptools packages the files into a standard `.whl` library.
   * **For Executables:** PyInstaller reads `umis.spec`, bundles the complete Python interpreter, and compiles the code and static folders into a single, standalone `UMIS.exe` binary.

## 3. How to Operate & Build the Packaging Pipelines

### A. The Universal Python Wheel (`.whl`)
Ideal for lightweight distribution on computers that already have Python installed.

#### 1. Rebuilding locally
Make sure your frontend is built, then run:
```bash
cd src/backend
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```
*Your universal wheel will be created inside `src/backend/dist/umis-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl`.*

#### 2. Deploying via GitHub Actions
We have automated this! Simply push a tag to GitHub to trigger compilation:
```bash
git tag v1.0.6
git push origin v1.0.6
```
GitHub Actions will automatically build, package, and upload the wheel directly to your **GitHub Releases** draft!

#### 3. Installing on an employee computer
Copy the `.whl` file to the target computer and run:
```bash
py -m pip install ./umis-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl --force-reinstall
```

#### 4. Launching the wheel system
```bash
py -m cli
```

---

### B. The Standalone Executable (`.exe`)
The premium, single-file Windows setup for standard employees with **zero technical prerequisites**.

#### 1. Prerequisites (For the developer compiling the EXE)
Install PyInstaller locally:
```bash
py -m pip install pyinstaller
```

#### 2. Compiling the `.exe`
Run the compiler inside the backend folder using your custom specification file:
```bash
cd src/backend
pyinstaller umis.spec
```
*PyInstaller will bundle all assets, dependencies, and the Python runtime into a single file.*

#### 3. Accessing the Executable
Once the build completes successfully, go to:
📁 **`src/backend/dist/`**
You will see your beautiful **`UMIS.exe`** file, customized with a medical cross icon!

#### 4. Deploying to Employees
1. Copy **`UMIS.exe`** to their computer (via USB, shared drive, or private link).
2. The employee simply **double-clicks the file** to run it. No installations, no terminals, and no configuration required!

---

### C. The 1-Click Automated Installer (Recommended)
This is the fastest and easiest way to distribute UMIS on employee computers. The script automatically installs Python (if missing), downloads the latest `.whl` package, configures silent background startup, and adds a Desktop shortcut—all in one command.

#### 1. Internet Installation (via GitHub)
If the employee computer has internet access, simply open **PowerShell** as an administrator (or normal user) and run:
```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bendeze/upemba-medical/main/scripts/install-umis.ps1 | iex"
```

#### 2. Offline USB Installation
If the employee computer is offline or if you prefer deploying from a USB:
1. Place the generated `umis-1.x.x-py3-none-any.whl` file inside the same folder as `install-umis.ps1` on your USB drive.
2. Open PowerShell in that folder and run:
```powershell
.\install-umis.ps1
```
The script will automatically detect the local `.whl` file and install it without reaching out to GitHub.

## 4. Automating Startup on Employee Machines

To provide a seamless experience for clinic employees, the 1-click installer (`install-umis.ps1`) completely automates the startup logic. It creates a hidden VBScript launcher and adds a shortcut to the Windows Startup folder. 

This means that whenever the computer boots, UMIS will start **silently in the background** without any distracting terminal windows, and it will automatically open the dashboard in the employee's default web browser.

If you ever need to debug the startup process or reconfigure the shortcuts manually, you can use the legacy configuration script located at `scripts/configure-startup.ps1`.
